Error: Cannot retrieve metalink for repository: epel. Please verify its path and try again
I solved this issue editing both /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo and /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-testing.repo files, commenting all entries starting with mirrorlist=... and uncomenting all the entries starting with baseurl=...
