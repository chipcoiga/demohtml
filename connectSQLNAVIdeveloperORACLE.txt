To connect sql developer to oracledb.

STEP1: START LISENER
	In oracle user type: oracle@gcsadmin# lsnrctl start

Some time you will see this message (if not you are done):
	"The listener supports no services"
	IF you see this message, you only need to setup ORACLE_HOME:
		oracle@gcsadmin# export ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/db_1

	then start lisener at STEP1 again.
	
	You will see: TNS-01106: Listener using listener name LISTENER has already been started

	WELDONE!

STEP2: CONNECT
	cONNECTION NAME: 	everything you in your mine
	USERNAME:		LEASING/NMS/T
	PASSWORD:		gcsvn123
	HOSTNAME:		IP OF DATABASE SERVER (172.20.2.75)
	PORT:			1521
	SID/SERVICE NAME:	PDBNAVI

Goodluck.
